      synopsis=`I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
        current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got
        every penny's worth.`
      review=`“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been
        looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing
        experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it
        incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the
        best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course,
        I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
        startup. ”`

      synopsis=`Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting
        guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.`
      review=`“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really
        refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go
        out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The
        standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need
        from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”`

        “ Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
        needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
        programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student
        of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The
        entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on
        and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
        particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a
        way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it
        during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
        certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
        multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
